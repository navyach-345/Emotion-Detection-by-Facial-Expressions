# Emotion Detection by Facial Expressions

This project utilizes MATLAB scripts to perform emotion detection based on facial expressions. It leverages facial features to identify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more through image processing and machine learning techniques.

## Project Structure

- `Alex_Validation.m`: This script likely handles the validation process of a trained model to evaluate its performance on a validation dataset.
- `Alex_train.m`: This script is used for training the model on a dataset of facial expressions.
- `mutliple_image_test.m`: This script is designed to test the model on multiple images, allowing batch processing of facial expression images.
- `test.m`: A general testing script, possibly for individual image testing.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure that you have MATLAB installed on your system, as this project requires MATLAB for running the scripts.

2. **Running the Training Script**:
   - Use the `Alex_train.m` script to train the model. This will likely require a dataset of facial expressions with labeled emotions.

3. **Validation**:
   - After training, run `Alex_Validation.m` to evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy and performance metrics on a validation dataset.

4. **Testing**:
   - Use `mutliple_image_test.m` for batch testing of images or `test.m` for testing individual images to detect emotions.
